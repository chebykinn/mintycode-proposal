# Add support for Github organisations

## Overview

In MintyCode user can add a GitHub repository to their profile to easily add
the projects to the platform.
Currently, they can't select or change the organisations from where MintyCode will read the list of repositories.

## Proposal

Improve new user experience - during the GitHub link process allow user to select the organisation which should be linked to MintyCode, instead of only showing the list from personal account.

## Next steps

In the future user should be able to add any number of organisations to their profile, and add collaborators via the platform.
